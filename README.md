# goodlife-classes


This program queches my ongoing curiosity about the goodlife fitness program. 

I always wanted to know what classes are the most popular and where are these classes are offered. I happened to come across the StackOverflow question the other day and I decided maybe I should scrape and mine the data myself.

Existing goodlife fitness class requires me to enter regions, cities and class name to retrieve the clubs and class schedule.

Regions, cities and classes can be easily retrieved from existing webservies offered (well, sort of...) by goodlife.

Apparently ***BodyPump*** is the most popular program in Canada, since 85 out of 87 cities are offering it. The only two cities not offering this course are ***Cochrane in Alberta*** and ***Alliston in Ontario***. Well, to be fair, they did not offer any other instructor-led program either and only virtual classes are offered in those two locations. Ouch. I probably wouldn't join the goodlife club there.

Some fun classes that are only offered in GTA, including ***Street Dance*** (Toronto, Ontario), ***Tai Chi*** (North York, Ontario), ***Power Play*** (Toronto, Ontario), ***Caribbean Dance Party*** (Scarborough, Ontario), ***Cardio Kickboxing*** (North York and Scarborough), ***Reggaecise***(North York and Scarborough). They are definitely on my bucket list now. So far I have only tried Street Dance, and it's *really* hardcore. No kidding.
